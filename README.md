This project aims to implement the ridge regression algorithm with square loss from scratch and use it to catch how accurately it can make predictions in the field. \\
The ridge regression is a statistical tool for modelling the relationship between some explanatory variables and some real-valued outcome that differs from the conventional linear regression for the so-called penalty coefficient α. The method is part of the learning paradigm known as Regularized Loss Minimization, RLM for short, which tries to stabilize the linear regression algorithm by adding a regularizer α that prevents the output from shifting too much even when inputs slightly change.\\
Beyond focusing on the performance of the training error, the experiment also shows how the cross-validated risk estimate changes along with the penalty coefficient alpha and if its stability increases after having scaled features through the principal component analysis (PCA).
